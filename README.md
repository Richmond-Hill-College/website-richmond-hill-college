# Richmond Hill College – Website

Next.js site (App Router) rebuilt from richmondhillcollege.ca, with **2-way sync** between GitHub and Vercel. All images are stored locally; SEO via metadata, sitemap, robots, and JSON-LD.

## App routes & sitemap

- **Sitemap:** Generated by [`app/sitemap.ts`](app/sitemap.ts). When adding a new page, add its path and priority there (and to `staticRoutes` or product list as appropriate).
- **Routes:** `/`, `/about-us`, `/programs`, `/course-offerings`, `/bridging-programs`, `/contact`, `/conferences`, `/conferences/nursing-and-healthcare-2025` (+ sub-pages: conference-main-page, registration, submit-abstract, invitation-letter, sponsorship, accommodations, program-table, abstract-proceeding-book, venue, contact-1), `/product/[id]/[slug]` (registration and sponsorship products; list in [`lib/products.ts`](lib/products.ts)).

## 2-way sync (GitHub ↔ Vercel)

1. **Connect the repo in Vercel**
   - [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) → **Add New** → **Project**
   - Import **Richmond-Hill-College/website-richmond-hill-college**
   - Vercel will detect Next.js and set build settings
   - Deploy

2. **What 2-way sync gives you**
   - **GitHub → Vercel:** Every push to the connected branch (e.g. `main`) triggers a production deploy. Pull requests get preview deployments.
   - **Vercel → GitHub:** (Optional) Use Vercel’s Git integration so preview/production URLs and status appear in GitHub (checks, comments).

3. **Local ↔ Vercel (optional)**
   - Install CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
   - In this repo: `vercel link` and pick the same Vercel project
   - Then `vercel` deploys a preview; `vercel --prod` deploys production. The `.vercel` folder is gitignored.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deploy

- **Via GitHub:** Push to the connected branch; Vercel deploys automatically.
- **Via CLI:** `vercel` (preview) or `vercel --prod` (production), after `vercel link`.
